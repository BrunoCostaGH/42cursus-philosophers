# 42cursus-philosophers ([Subject](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/65766/en.subject.pdf))

## Description
Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

## Usage

```unix
  ./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat] 
```
